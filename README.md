Development of technical skills in Java and Angular

Certainly! Testing provides a crucial opportunity to refine, improve, and ensure the quality of our work. It allows us to identify potential issues, make necessary adjustments, and ultimately deliver a better product or service to those who rely on it. So, let's express gratitude for the chance to test, learn, and grow. Thank you for the opportunity to make testing a part of our process, leading to better outcomes and more tremendous success.

Deploying a project involves several steps to ensure that your application can be run in a local environment. Here's a basic outline of the deployment process:

#### 1. Installing a PostgreSQL database involves executing the *[registerdb.sql](https://github.com/jlopez34/equifaxTest/blob/master/registerdb.sql)* on a server or local machine. It can find that one in the root of this repository.

#### 2. After downloading *[apirest-register](https://github.com/jlopez34/equifaxTest/tree/master/apirest-register)*  sources on a local machine, using some IDE to reload the sources for that project using IntelliJ IDEA is possible.
- Java 17 or lastest 
- Spring Boot 3.2

#### 3. After the project runs, the following Postman collection could be used to prove the several services.

#### 4. According to step two, It is necessary to download the frontend project; that project is localized in the following path *[login-home](https://github.com/jlopez34/equifaxTest/tree/master/login-home)*.
- Angular 17

#### 5. After the project loads on the preference editor, it is required to use the following instructions:
```
npm install
ng serve
```
#### 5. Finally, It should open the preference browser and access to endpoint: [http://localhost:4200/home ](http://localhost:4200/home)
